title: About the ATACAMA Group
---

We are a group of students and posttdocs aiming to delve deeper into the
methods and techniques used in applied research.

Our group generally meets every two weeks.

Because our focus is on foundational and widely applicable underlying
techniques, all disciplines and backgrounds are welcome.

This group schedules the time for discussing topics you don't have time to
learn and to expand your knowledge on what you don't know.
